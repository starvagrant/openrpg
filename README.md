This is the programming component of my new card game superpac, currently in development. Superpac hopes to emulate the unpredictable and shadowy strategic planning of financing modern elections. 

The rules are currently in a state of flux during play testing, but there are two mechanics I'm currently committed to keeping. Super PACs win solely by who closely a candidate aligns with their interests. Parties and political ideologies only serve to rally voters.

Second, the delayed action mechanic. Although it's form may be modified, players can affect other players or perhaps other players, based on cards that are hidden from play two turns in the future. Thus players can scheme and squabble, but each are just a little behind their opponent's in reacting. 

In any case, here are the **current** ideas, I still need to respond to the criticisms of two of my gaming buddies on the concept:

There are any number of superpacs, which have different competing interests in government policy. This are

1. *Military vs. Peace*: The monied interests of the superpac benefit for peace or war.
2. *Economic Stability vs Economic Speculation*: How the superpac prefers economic stablity by a regulated market or a boom and bust cycle fueled by speculators
3. *Infrastructure vs. Austerity*: How much the superpac favors government investment in infrastructure vs. cutting costs
4. *Nationalism vs. Globalization*: How much the superpac favors global corporations over nationalist interests.
5. *Energy Intensity vs. Conservation*: How the much the superpac favors a strategy of rapid explotation of resources vs. a policy of efficiency and conservation. 

My original idea was for having one super pac for each interest (totalling five), though a suggestion that also seems likely is for each superpac to represent two competing interests. The relationship between interests and super pacs, so far are as follows. 

1. The MIlitary Industrial Complex
2. Wall Street
3. The Pharmaceutical Industy
4. The Chinese Communist Party
5. The Energy Industry

**The Military Industrial Complex** favors war, a stable government that invests in infrastructure, the liberal use of fossil fossil fules, and has a strong nationalist bent. **Allies**: The Pharmaceutical Industry, The Energy Industry. **Competitors**: The Community Party, Wall Street.

**Wall Street** is behind classical laissez faire economics. Market fluctations grant lucky / savvy investors to score big. Wall Street bankers would prefer to keep taxes low than to build infrastructure. Whilst war makes a tidy profit and attracts businessmen, it also strains trade relations and stops the rapid pace of globalization, which Wall Street much prefers, as it gives markets power over governments. Lastly, as there's no speculation like energy prices, it favors liberal issue of fossil fuels: **Allies**: The Chinese Communist Party, The Energy Industry. **Competitors** The Military, The Pharmaceutical Industry

**The Pharmaceutical Industry** benefits greatly both from investors speculation and from basic government research and the university system, which often provides them with medical knowledge not profitable for them to pursue on their own. They also greatly appreciate the benefits of globalization, what lets them move their polluting factories to the contries with the most agreeable turns. Not opposed to war in theory, it does detract from civilian investment, which they need to remain profitable. Lastly, they depend on petrochemicals to manufacturing their products, so squandering this products is something they wish to avoid. **Allies** the Chinese Communist Party, Wall Street **Competitors** Tne Energy Industry, The Military Industrial Complex

**The Chinese Communist Party** has an interesting relationship with American policy. They love global investors, and global investors love them. They seek to court American money whilst keeping a military (which tends to see it as a rival) at bay. They love globalization, because while they keep Chinese national power strong, it erodes national governments elsewhere, including the US. It's in good with the pharmaceutical industry, the nation is much more flexible on industrial pollution. It isn't so hot on the American energy industry, which they know is rigged to keep them paying more for energy than their American counterparts. **Allies**: Wall Street, The Pharmaceutical Company **Competitors** The Military, The Energy Industry

**The Energy Industry** needs financing and customers. Which put it in line with Wall Street and the Military. More war means more oil, and deregulation and speculation fuels profits. The American industry is very much interested in keeping it's major customer, the United States both firmly in control of international affairs and the government's eye towards foreign affairs (particularly the Middle East) rather than domestic concerns. **Allies**
