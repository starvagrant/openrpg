Open Character Management System

This project is to create a way to easily manage tabletop roleplaying games, perhaps multiple sessions

### Goal ###

Tabletop roleplaying games seem to me the ultimate for of gaming, provided one person is willing
to put forth extraordinary energy as the game's moderator known by various systems as the Dungeon Master,
Game Master, Storyteller, etc. This is full of loosely organized character sheets, NPC's, inventories, 
experience points, battles, etc. In other words a complete mess. This project should help you keep track
of characters in an easy, user friendly manner. Wherever possible, this will attempt avoid game
mechanics from any particular system, so as to be as cross-platform as possible. However, it would be 
impossible to develop anything without making reference to a particular system. So, systems I'm familiar
with AND like:

- Mage the Ascension: 2nd Edition
- Vampire the Masquerade: 2nd Edition
- Werewolf the Apocalypse: 2nd Edition
- Call of Cthulhu: 6th Edition
- Rifts
- Paranoia
- Shadowrun (know the universe but don't have the books)

I don't like D and D. I've always felt the core character types too generic, and the system to emphasize die rolling
over actual roleplaying. Statistically I don't like the the 20 sided die. I've always felt that, if I
have a good idea of what my character can do, I shouldn't be constantly surprised by failures introduced by random
die rolling. I don't think the 20 sided die leads to this conclusion. (I prefer several d10's or d6's) Feel free to 
fork this project to include the system. (GPL 2.0 and all).

Feel free to check back for notes on core concepts as they are developed.
