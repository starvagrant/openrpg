<p>This is the programming component of my new card game superpac, currently in development. Superpac hopes to emulate the unpredictable and shadowy strategic planning of financing modern elections. </p>

<p>The rules are currently in a state of flux during play testing, but there are two mechanics I'm currently committed to keeping. Super PACs win solely by who closely a candidate aligns with their interests. Parties and political ideologies only serve to rally voters.</p>

<p>Here are the <strong>current</strong> ideas, I still need to respond to the criticisms of two of my gaming buddies on the concept:</p>

<p>There are any number of superpacs, which have different competing interests in government policy. This are</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Military vs. Peace</em>: The monied interests of the superpac benefit for peace or war.
<em>. _Economic Stability vs Economic Speculation</em>: How the superpac prefers economic stablity by a regulated market or a boom and bust cycle fueled by speculators</li>
<li><em>Infrastructure vs. Austerity</em>: How much the superpac favors government investment in infrastructure vs. cutting costs</li>
<li><em>Nationalism vs. Globalization</em>: How much the superpac favors global corporations over nationalist interests.</li>
<li><em>Energy Intensity vs. Conservation</em>: How the much the superpac favors a strategy of rapid explotation of resources vs. a policy of efficiency and conservation. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Game Objectives</h3>

<p>Each player runs a super pac, with an objective to jockey as much political favor in a certain area of policy. Super Pacs show little interest in actual candidates or their regards for other issues. As the game moves forward super pacs have the discretion of running candidates in races. Each candidate falls somewhere on the spectrum of the five issues noted above, even if completely moderate / malleable on an issue. The game runs through two cycles, a primary season, where running candidates is easier, and an election season, where fundraising is easier and you have a better idea of where the general public stands on the issues. </p>

<p>The game consists of three kinds of cards. A candidate card represents an actual candidate that can run for office. Each candidate has a number representing their general stance. These are point values a super pac is looking to favor. For a candidate card to have any effect, that candidate must run in an election, and their stances only matter if they win. All winning candidates have their stances tallied. Players then score points based on their superpac's objectives. </p>

<p>Action cards represent events. Some of these events happen to candidates or a race which consists of several candidates. Action cards may also directly affect players. An action card is first played (revealed to all players) and then resolved, meaning its effects occur. An action card does not resolve immediately on being played. The player chooses when, during their action phase, to resolve a card played on their turn. Some cards resolve immediately upon being played, and this is noted on that card. If a card is played, which by the rules cannot be resolved, the card is discarded. </p>

<p>Last are the money cards. These represent both financial contributions to candidates (which determines elections) or the potential to fund political activities (drawing action cards). Money comes in two varieties, clean and dirty. Clean money is totally safe to spend or keep. You can spend it on candidates by placing it under a candidate card. or using it to fund your political activities (draw action cards). Dirty money has higher monetary value, and is safe to spend, but dangerous to keep. A player with dirty money can be hit by an audit, and a candidate with dirty money can be caught up in a scandal.</p>

<p>Throughout the game, candidates will have debates. During these debates, a candidate on the right side of an issue will gain money cards at random from the money card deck, which represents the value of popular support. In the transition from primary to election, a game wide debate roll is cast for every candidate. This makes things tricky for political strategy. A candidate with strong earlier backing may lose out if they are on the wrong side of the issues. Alternatively, backing a candidate on the right side of the issues early on may have onlookers feel the race is "already decided". Resolving debate rolls will be discussed later. </p>

<h3>Game Play (rules version 0.1)</h3>

<p>The Game Begins in Primary Mode. In Primary Mode, running candidates is easy, whilst fundraising is hard. In Election Mode, running new candidates is harder, but raising money is easier. </p>

<p>Turn Order:
1. During Primary Season, Two New Candidates Present Themselves to Run. Any player may run them. 
2. At the end of a player's last turn, each other player has played an action card against that player. These were placed face down. Turn these cards face up, they are considered played and must be resolved.
3. Player draws a card from the action pile, and one from the money pile.
4. Player may perform any number of actions, in any order. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Resolve an action card. Player has discretion to order, but all cards played most be resolved.</li>
<li>Playing an action card from one's hand.</li>
<li>Make a campaign contribution to a candidate by placing a money card face down under them.</li>
<li>Once per turn, during the primaries, run a candidate from the open candidates stack. </li>
<li>Once per turn, purchase an action card.</li>
<li><p>Once per turn, acquire money cards via a fundraiser action card.</p></li>
<li><p>All players who are not taking a turn draw an action card.</p></li>
<li>All players play an action card, face down, for that player to resolve next turn.</li>
</ul>

<p>The action deck consists of ten cards:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>Primary.</em> </p>

<p>Player may run a candidate during a primary. This may be chosen from the open candidates pile or chosen at random off the deck.
In the case of being used on an opponent, a random card is played off the candidate deck, but that opponent may choose the race.
If primary season is over, one card gets added to the open candidates pile. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Election.</em> </p>

<p>Election cards work the same way primary cards do, except that they can only be resolved during the election phase. (During primary season they are discarded) During the election phase, however, a candidate my only run in an open election with no more than one candidate already in it.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Backdoor Deal.</em> </p>

<p>Allows the player to search the deck for a money card of his or her choosing. This is card is placed face down to be shown drawn the next turn. A player with a backdoor deal in progress can be hit with bad action cards, such as audit, but these cards only affect dirty money. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Super Pac.</em> </p>

<p>A player is marked as having a secondary super pac. During the part 5 of a turn, when players would be drawing a card because they are not taking a turn. A player with a super pac draws two cards and discards one. If played on an opponent, the opponent gets the super pac. If a player already has a super pac, this card is not resolved and discarded.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Fundraiser.</em> </p>

<p>Draw two money cards during primary season, three in a general election</p></li>
<li><p><em>Rally</em> </p>

<p>Place a random money card under a candidate. Alternately, place two money cards on the candidate furthest behind.   </p></li>
<li><p><em>Debate</em>  </p>

<p>Make a debate roll in a particular race.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Media Blitz</em></p>

<p>Place three random money cards under a given candidate. Remove them at the end of your next turn. Do not remove them if you would not take another turn. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Scandal</em> </p>

<p>A candidate hit with a scandal loses their half their financial backing rounded up. Remove them from under the candidate and turn them face up. If the candidate has money from illicit sources they are removed from the race. </p></li>
<li><p><em>Audit</em> </p>

<p>A chance to really hammer a player, rather than a candidate. When an audit is played, it must be resolved before any other action card. The player whose turn it is gets audited, and must reveal their hand and all pending backdoor deals. If any dirty money cards are in that players hand, they must reveal the super pac they belong to. A player cannot be audited until the general election. </p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Resolving Debate Rolls</strong></p>

<p>A player picks an election and rolls two dice. The first roll determines the issue: 1) military 2) market regulation 3) infrastructure 4) nationalism 5) energy policy 6) player chooses the issue. For the second die: 1-2 means the candidate with the lowest score wins. 3-4 means the candidate with the score closest to zero wins. 5-6 means the candidate with the highest score wins. Ties are resolved with rerolls. In the odd event of a tie that cannot be resolved, all candidates are considered to have lost the debate (no action cards) </p>

<p><strong>Dirty Money</strong> </p>

<p>There are fifteen unique cards that represent money gained from illicit sources. All but one function the same way: a candidate hit with a scandal is out of the race, and a player with an audit most reveal their super pac. One dirty money card is particularly damning however, the nuclear secrets card. In a race with a candidate hit by a scandal, all other remaining money cards are overturned and the election is decided immediately thereafter. Essentially, the second best candidate seizes on the scandal, earns public sympathy, and can't lose. A player hit by an audit with the nuclear secrets card not only reveals their super pac, but also must spend the rest of the game with their hand revealed. Essentially, in a bid to save itself the Super Pac tries playing super clean. </p>

<h3>Example of game play.</h3>

<p>It is the second turn of four players, everyone has gone once. Player 1 has thus received four action cards from the other players, and has two in his hand, along with one clean money card and one dirty money card. Player receives a primary card, a media blitz, a scandal, and a fundraiser. The player then draws an audit, and an additional clean money card. The player could: </p>

<ol>
<li>Place any of the money cards under a candidate.</li>
<li>Spend one of their money cards to by an action card.</li>
<li>Use the fundraiser card to draw an action card.</li>
<li>Run a media blitz placing three money under any given candidate, then resolve the scandal, and hope that candidate has some dirty money under it. (A player could do it in the opposite order, but at this point in the race, it would probably be a waste.</li>
<li>Run one candidate from the open candidates pile.</li>
<li>Use the primary card to run the candidate off the top of the deck.</li>
<li>Pass, once all their event cards have triggered.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The player may not</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Audit themselves, not because you can't audit yourself, but because it's too early in the game. A player that audits themselves faces all the penalties that normally happen when another player slips them an audit card. This generally wouldn't be a good idea, but their may be some limited cases where a player might want to do this.</li>
<li>Resolve a fundraiser card, because only one fundraiser can be resolved a turn. No restrictions are placed on running unsuccessful fundraisers. </li>
<li>Fail to resolve their action cards. A primary race must occur, along with a scandal, media blitz, and fundraiser. The player may wish to resolve the fundraiser first, so as to have more potential dirty money to take advantage of the scandal card.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Election Rules:</strong></p>

<p>The game will transition from primary to general elections. In this stage running candidates is harder, money comes easier, and more scrutiny is paid to candidate's finances.</p>

<ol>
<li>The open candidate pile no longer grows on its own, nor can you run candidates with primary cards. Primary cards can be played to increase the open candidate pile, but only by one.</li>
<li>Once per turn, when you buy two or more action cards, you may draw another from the deck.</li>
<li>The fundraiser card gains you an additional action card.</li>
<li>Audits may be played, including on players that have unresolved backdoor deals from the primary season. </li>
<li>On the last turn, media blitzes do not result in loss of cards at the end of turn. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>End of election</strong>:</p>

<p>Winning Candidates are determined, based on their financial backing. In a race, all money cards are flipped over and counted. Any ties in finances are resolved with debate rolls. In the event that a debate roll cannot determine the winner (that is, the candidates stand the same on both issues) a "recount" must be performed. Just discard one of the candidates and count their stances on the issues. Players win based on the points that count at the end of the election. </p>

<p><strong>Notes for testing</strong></p>

<p>Currently, each card is playing a dual role, one to play on your own turn, and one to play on your opponent's turn. There should be three types of events.
1. <em>Election events</em> which represent an event happening to a candidate. This will benefit the player that they happen to, because they control how the election event happens.
2. <em>Harmful Player Events</em> that mostly represent bad things happening to that player.
3. <em>Beneficial Player Events</em> that pretty much help a player no matter what.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions From Other Testers</strong></p>

<p>As I write this, I've received some input from other testers. In short, they want to ensure there's a good combination of random elements versus strategy. So:</p>

<ol>
<li>Election events are to help you when you play them, and collect intel when your opponent plays them. In the current scenario of the game, most of your election events will be provided by others. This is sort of an important point. With these action events, you're essentially receiving a hand based on the collective mindset of the players two turns ago. </li>
<li>Nasties for the opponent. A player with collective disapproval should start receiving some nasties, but not too many. The problem with loading adverse events is for a player to, every turn, be responding to nasties from multiple players. But the nasties need to be available enough that no one feels the need to hoard them.</li>
<li>Cards that unambiguously help the player that gets them, player or opponent. The purpose of these would be twofold. As action cards you want to play them. Currently a game mechanic punishes over aggressive use of action cards. (That is, without holding an action card in your hand so as to prevent the possibility that an opponent gets one by accident.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Game Play</strong></p>

<p>My current mechanics actually remind me a bit of Robo Rally. In that game, you get nine random movement cards to guide your robot. You determine the order in which your robot moves. As the game progresses you may take damage, restricting your movement until at some point there's no set of moves that won't end in death. Problems with Robo Rally:</p>

<ol>
<li>There's very little room to be competitive against other players. With the movement and weapons provided, other players are extraordinarily hard to damage and take down.</li>
<li>Turns where you can do nothing. Part of Robo Rally is not getting too attached to acheiving something in any given turn. If you don't you will go nuts, and probably drag the other players with you. </li>
</ol>

<p>With my plan as it stands, each turn, a play will be dealing with an uncoordinated, semi-random attack from the other players. It's stumbling and awkward, the same way going up against someone in Robo Rally would be. But this game is both political and strategic. There must be a part of the game directly within a player's control As I write this, I've received some input from other testers. In short, they want to ensure there's a good combination of random elements versus strategy. So:</p>

<p>With my plan as it stands, each turn, a play will be dealing with an uncoordinated, semi-random attack from the other players. It's stumbling and awkward, the same way going up against someone in Robo Rally would be. But this game is both political and strategic. There must be a part of the game directly within a player's control. That's where the candidates come in. Your points come from the candidates, nothing else. So... it needs to be relatively obvious for a thinking player whether a candidate hurts / helps their agenda. The number of races should be limited enough that you can begin to read someone else's agenda, but not so limited as to lock players into a losing strategy. I wish to avoid a Catan like setup, where the strategy you get locked into starts practically immediately and there's nothing you can do about it. </p>

<p>Scaling the game: this is clearly going to be a very different game based on the number of players. There are plenty of good games like this, Mtg, Agricola, Globalization. Though it's a bad game, Monopoly comes to mind. The more players, the more political the game gets. </p>

<p>My original idea was for having one super pac for each interest (totalling five), though a suggestion that also seems likely is for each superpac to represent two competing interests. The relationship between interests and super pacs, so far are as follows. </p>

<ol>
<li>The MIlitary Industrial Complex</li>
<li>Wall Street</li>
<li>The Pharmaceutical Industy</li>
<li>The Chinese Communist Party</li>
<li>The Energy Industry</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The Military Industrial Complex</strong> favors war, a stable government that invests in infrastructure, the liberal use of fossil fossil fules, and has a strong nationalist bent. <strong>Allies</strong>: The Pharmaceutical Industry, The Energy Industry. <strong>Competitors</strong>: The Community Party, Wall Street.</p>

<p><strong>Wall Street</strong> is behind classical laissez faire economics. Market fluctations grant lucky / savvy investors to score big. Wall Street bankers would prefer to keep taxes low than to build infrastructure. Whilst war makes a tidy profit and attracts businessmen, it also strains trade relations and stops the rapid pace of globalization, which Wall Street much prefers, as it gives markets power over governments. Lastly, as there's no speculation like energy prices, it favors liberal issue of fossil fuels: <strong>Allies</strong>: The Chinese Communist Party, The Energy Industry. <strong>Competitors</strong> The Military, The Pharmaceutical Industry</p>

<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Industry</strong> benefits greatly both from investors speculation and from basic government research and the university system, which often provides them with medical knowledge not profitable for them to pursue on their own. They also greatly appreciate the benefits of globalization, what lets them move their polluting factories to the contries with the most agreeable turns. Not opposed to war in theory, it does detract from civilian investment, which they need to remain profitable. Lastly, they depend on petrochemicals to manufacturing their products, so squandering this products is something they wish to avoid. <strong>Allies</strong> the Chinese Communist Party, Wall Street <strong>Competitors</strong> Tne Energy Industry, The Military Industrial Complex</p>

<p><strong>The Chinese Communist Party</strong> has an interesting relationship with American policy. They love global investors, and global investors love them. They seek to court American money whilst keeping a military (which tends to see it as a rival) at bay. They love globalization, because while they keep Chinese national power strong, it erodes national governments elsewhere, including the US. It's in good with the pharmaceutical industry, the nation is much more flexible on industrial pollution. It isn't so hot on the American energy industry, which they know is rigged to keep them paying more for energy than their American counterparts. <strong>Allies</strong>: Wall Street, The Pharmaceutical Company <strong>Competitors</strong> The Military, The Energy Industry</p>

<p><strong>The Energy Industry</strong> needs financing and customers. Which put it in line with Wall Street and the Military. More war means more oil, and deregulation and speculation fuels profits. The American industry is very much interested in keeping it's major customer, the United States both firmly in control of international affairs and the government's eye towards foreign affairs (particularly the Middle East) rather than domestic concerns. <strong>Allies</strong> Wall Street, The Military <strong>Competitors</strong> The Pharmaceutical Industry, The Chinese Communist Party.   </p>
