What does the game consist of?

	People
		_Types_	
		Player Characters
		NPC's
		Enemies
	Plot
		Missions (PC's)
		Campaign Setting
		Universe
	Setting
		Theme (sci fi, fantasy, etc.)
		Difference From Reality (how the game world is different from ours)
		History (what has gone on in the setting in the past)

Of course these are interrelated. How to map the relationships between them?
Work on an actual mission tracker. What happens on a campaign? Generally the group
is supposed to DO something. It's very much bound by the rules of a good story.

**So what is a good story?**

Stories are about making choices. Our desire for stories is a desire to learn from
the mistakes of others, in an environment that is partially removed from judgment. 
It becomes more ok to explore certain actions if they happened in the past or may 
happen, and are being done by others. Roleplaying shares the same issues of any 
story, and favorite memories are precisely those moments where the unexpected happens.
So think, it's not really fun to play if the boss can't kill you. It's not really fun
if the puzzles don't stump you. Of course, some chance of success is also necessary. 

Think, too about what happens in a game when an established team "can't lose". Either
you route for the underdog, or you start betting on a spread. You start to redefine 
success from "who has the most points" to "who many points can I beat them by?" 
Otherwise, "games" stop being games and turn into something else. If a certain player
or team feels they "must win" means the game has turned into asserting dominance. 
I learned this from games I used to play as a kid. I've known some people who wouldn't
play a game with me when they had a geniune fear of losing. Granted, this probably 
happens a fair amount when you win all the time. So, this is just some rambling. The
point to make here is about the need for a challenge. You don't go to the bother of
making characters so you can yak all night. 

So, the points is that there's a mission to be done. So what defines a mission

	Type Mission
		Players
		Employer	
		Goal
			Stated Goal
			What Happened
			Deemed Success
		Obstacles
			Physical Obstacles
				Money / Supplies
				Transportation
				Intelligence
				Medical Care
			Blocking Characters
				Enemies
				Third Parties
				Interparty conflict
		Consequences
			On Players
			On Enemies
			On Scene
			On Universe

Explanation: 
- Players (the characters)
- Employer (who are the characters working for? Themselves or an employer?
- Goal: the stated goal (what has the employer said they have to do), what actually happened,
and whether the actual events can be considered success or failure
- Obstacles: 
> Physical Obstacles, what's physical stopping the party. Do they need money or equipment?
Do they need transportation? Do they need to heal? Does the objective (if it's somewhere else) need to
be observed for some reason (such as observing guard routes / patrols). 
Blocking
> Blocking Characters. Who are the enemies? What parties might alter the outcome, without having a stake
in winners and losers? How might the party members be the biggest challenge?
- Consequences on players / their faction, on enemies / their factions, on the playable scene (story elements
that will get back to the players, and on the universe (story elements which would affect players in other 
unrelated games).
